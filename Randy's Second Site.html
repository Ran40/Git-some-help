		<h1>Randy's Site: Part 2!</h1>
		<p>Hello again! In case you forgot who I was (I myself almost did, honestly), I'm Randy. It's a pleasure.</p>
			<p>-Today, I'll be showing you how to make yourself a milkshake. It's a simple process, but it usually results in something good, so how could it hurt to show you?</p>
				<p>-First things first, you're gonna need ice cream. Obviously, it's what milkshakes are built upon. Now, any ice cream will do as long as it's Personally, I enjoy using vanilla ice cream (which is trash by itself, by the way). About 7 scoops is what I prefer.</p>
					<p>-Next, take whatever it is you need to make it a certain flavor and add it. I have a peanut butter milkshake in mind--which you obviously don't want if you're allergic, so again, use whatever you want--so 3 spoonfuls will do.</p>
						<p>-Then, add some milk for your desired thickness. I usually add one liter of milk since I don't like when milkshakes are very thick, but make sure you add enough so that your ingredients mix well and that you don't end up breaking your blender....<iframe width="420" height="345"

							<p>-Finally, once mixed to your satisfaction, taste it. If it's not doing it for you, add some more ice cream, your "whatever", or both.
								<p>-And with that, you're done! Hopefully, this was a simple, fun process for you. Enjoy your shake!</p>
